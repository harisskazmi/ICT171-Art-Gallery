The easiest way to link a domain to your EC2 server is to make a record.

### Create a Record

#### Record 1:
- **Type:** A Record
- **Host:** @
- **Value:** <your.EC2.server.Public.IP>
- **TTL:** Automatic

>This record maps your root domain to your EC2 instance's IPv4 address. So when someone types your domain into a browser, DNS knows to send them to your server.

#### Record 2: 
- **Type:** A Record
- **Host:** www
- **Value:** <your.EC2.server.Public.IP>
- **TTL:** Automatic

>This lets people access your site via www.<your_domain_name>.<your_TLD> as well â€” it points that subdomain to the same EC2 IP.

After these changes, it may take a few minutes up to a few hours for the DNS changes to update through the internet.
>You can check by going to your domain and seeing if it takes you to your EC2 server. You can also do this through your terminal by using the command:
>```bash
>ping <your_domain_name>.<your_TLD>
>```
